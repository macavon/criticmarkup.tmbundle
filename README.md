# Introduction

This is a [TextMate][tm] Bundle to work with [CriticMarkup][cm].  It supports syntax highlighting and the basic commands to work with plain text editorial annotations.

This fork was done mainly for my own use, to adjust the commands to suit my way of working. I leave it here in case it is useful to anyone else. No guarantees â€“ I know it isn't foolproof by any means.

Main differences from the origin:

* Simplified by replacing commands by snippets where possible.
* Changed keyboard equivalents, all use ctl-opt modifiers now
* Removed accept all and reject all.
* Added Next (macro) to find next mark
* Added Accept and Reject commands to accept/reject current command

## Installation

The bundle is not supported by the Textmate team, so you need to install it by hand. Download or clone this repository, then double-click the `.tmbundle` to install.
